### (Unofficial) Software Engineering FAQs ###

#### What is this page? ####

If you've received an offer of admission to the
University of Waterloo, congratulations! We can't
wait to have you join us on campus.

This page contains commonly-asked questions from
first-year students.

#### I heard that there are a lot of Chinese-speaking students on campus. Do I need to know how to speak Chinese to fit in? ####

No. :)

#### I'm not very good at English. Is there help for me at Waterloo? ####

Students who fail the English Language Proficiency
Test (ELPE) will have further assistance (e.g. 
workshops, strategy sessions) made available to them.

For more details, visit the University of Waterloo
website: [http://uwaterloo.ca/english-language-proficiency/english-language-proficiency-examination](http://uwaterloo.ca/english-language-proficiency/english-language-proficiency-examination)

#### What if my question isn't answered here? ####

Unfortunately, orientation leaders aren't allowed to
interact with specific students one-on-one until
after the first week of classes. If your question
isn't answered here, here are a few options:

* Submit a pull request or bug report on github for [cbhl/se2014.com](http://github.com/cbhl/se2014.com)
* Ask an upper-year who isn't an orientation leader
* Email the Director of SE (see [http://www.softeng.uwaterloo.ca/Administration/contact.htm](http://www.softeng.uwaterloo.ca/Administration/contact.htm))
