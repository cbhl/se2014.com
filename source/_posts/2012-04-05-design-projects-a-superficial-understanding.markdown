"I think Paul Thagard is a good customer." -D. Rayside

The most important thing we found is choosing your group is a key step. You'll be with them for a year and a half andi you should be sure you'll work well.

Half your group won't be interested and you'll be working by yourself... and there will be unhappiness.

"The difference between your project group and marriage is that in marriage you can get divorced." -P. Ward

"In the class of 2011, a divorce did happen, but that meant someone transferred out of the program. Outside of that, we haven't really had any serious problems..." -D. Rayside

Trying to defer group formation from the very beginning. What happens is, "here are my buddies"... - project ideas, having people coalesce project ideas. Better than "who you drink beer with."

Work with people with the same work ethic. Want to pick people who start assignments the day before it's due if you start assignments the day before it's due. The best way to do this is to pick people you've worked with before, and what kinds of things have made you unhappy.

Group building is important.

Like roommates. Not everyone that you're good friends with is someone you want to be roommates with (e.g. b/c of cleanliness).

Time management, coding styles should also match. (Write and refactor versus sit down and plan.)

Don't be afraid to work with someone you've never worked with before.

Projects.
---------

Depends on one's goals for what they wish to accomplish. Should have some idea.

E.g. Build something the client will use

Very useful to have a real client.

Requirements tend to slip each week... 

The problem is, it's summer time... there's trains and there's graphics. These things all apply pressure to distract you from the design project.

"I'm adding a bit of structure." Informal social thing.

Motivations:
- Marks, structure, a bit of a drag
- Social pressure, good-natured/good-humored every team submits lines and hours and we take the top and bottom and annoit them as "professionals" and "mediocrity"
- Hopefully every group will have a VM which will have e.g. bug tracker to integrate with VCS

"Here's a story, an unprofessional story in a sense, of a wiki that lived on a machine in someone's office. And that hard drive died." --D. Rayside.

The 2012 class has left artifacts for you to study. Electronic backups by ECE... hopefully.

"I want to keep the data in a programatically convenient form." --D. Rayside.

Running he Project
------------------

First two terms, coded up to the deadline of the demo.

- Bugs
- Demo didn't really work
  - This doesn't work, but it'll work in the future, so give us marks.


"I will punish you for not having an automated build system." --D. Rayside.

- Test harness, build system, bug tracker... all that stuff is useful.

A week before demo, we stopped all coding and just worked on bug fixing... so our demo actually worked.

Meaningful commit messages!

Commit discipline -- each commit should specifically fix a bug or implement a feature so you don't have weeks of code dangling on a commit.

Unit tests.

From what I know of your class, I want to see what you guys do. Hackathons and individual projects. :D

Actually doing it...

When deciding what to do, it's fun ,because you can pick problems out of the air and brainstorm crazy things that you could possibly do. At the end of the day, even if there aren't any hard set deadlines, you have to manage your time... at the end of the day, you have to say what are we doing to do and what is the core of this thing and what are the things we have to have done and what are the things that are nice to do. It's important to get to that step because you won't get done.

Write ideas down!

Issue Tracking
- github :D

Picking Project:
- chunk things off
- not that much time
- "Oh god, doing half o this project is like doing ten design projects."
- Pretend each member has 40 hours (one work week) and that you could have something to show to someone and get marks for. (It works, and it semi-accomplishes my goal.) Then you can go off and add stuff.
- Estimate that you can spend all this time on your work term... but you don't.
- Groups that *do* work during work term report being ahead of the game.

Web related stuff
- domains
  - don't use godaddy
  - not cheap if you use whoisguard
  - jerks
  - dns updating is slow
  - namecheap is okay

- emails
  - experimenting with services
  - nice to have a separate email for signing up for stuff
  - free tier of google apps, e.g.
  - namecheap has one-click google apps activation
  - catch-all + forwarding :3
  - useful if you want to split off project for a startup

- avoids single point of failure on a single person
  - if you get hit by a bus, can your group  keep going without you?

- hosting
  - aws, linode
  - useful because you can build from the ground up... learn sysadmin stuff
  - ymmv, <=> frameworks like app engine, elastic beanstalk very limiting
  - openbsd?

- ssl
  - you don't need to pay for a signed ssl cert
  - cert.startcom.org - free SSL certificates
  - startssl.com

- frameworks
  - do one that you're not familiar with, even if you hear that it sucks
  - you can learn why you don't like django over RoR :D
  - interesting to see how they are constructed, see how they solve website-building problem
 
- ORMs are evil
  - be aware of the relations of your ORM (e.g. ActiveRecord)
  - SQL is powerful and it's hard to abstract well in code
  - may be difficult to abstract complex JOIN queries in a way the ORM can handle

- symposium day
  - you're working towards the one demo at the end of 4B
  - people will respond will to a good idea
  - prizes were for projects that _solved a problem_
  - it's easy to get caught up in execution, but judges may select based on good idea with mediocre execution

- research projects...

- pick people you don't know
  - so you can learn to work with people you haven't picked
  - spending time trying to find a consensus is difficult
  - pick a benevolent dictator to handle decision-making
  - clear decision-making structure

- External Customers
  - handle IP, compensation issues beforehand
  - template legal documents hopefully available in the fall

- e.g. 2010
  - "client" sold app to the TTC, students got no money

- Policy 73

- don't work with a boyfriend/girlfriend in a design project unless you have a prenup and/or would  marry them IRL
  - if you break up and you still have to work with them for design project, it's tough

"I'm not sure I'd want to work with my wife. You know, seeing the same person 168 hours a week. Maybe your relationship is more likely to succeed if you're ing different project groups." -D. Rayside

- SE student group names...
  - maybe numbers
