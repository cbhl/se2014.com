Having completed their design projects, the SE2012 class gave an informal presentation today to share their experiences.

### 1

* Choosing your group is the key step, will be with them for 1.5 years
  * Similar interests
  * Similar work ethic (eg people who start early)
  * Find people you've worked with before, people who you know you can work with
  * Hopefully have similar coding styles
  * Derek: Paul Ward says "The difference between marriage and your group is that you can divorce a marriage."

* Thoughts on project selection
  * Good to have some ultimate "goal" for your project
    * eg produce something real for someone to use - best to have a client to work with

* Derek (aside): "Problem" with trains and graphics distracting students from design project in 490 (4A term)
  * Social pressure as a form of motivation?

* On running the project
  * Be aware of things like bug trackers, build systems, test harnesses
    * Unit tests can be very, very useful
  * Have "feature freezes" early, to reserve time to fix bugs
  * Comment: Have meaningful commit messages
  * Have commit discipline (commit after each specific bug/feature)

### 2

* It's fun to brainstorm and come up with ideas
  * But it's important to get a core idea to work with
  * Comment: Take notes, record all ideas
* Need to manage time properly - deadlines may be far, but they exist

### 3

* GitHub is really easy for commits/bug tracking
* When picking design project
  * Keep in mind that time is limited
  * Don't let the scope of your project get out of hand
  * Estimate 40 hours per person of time to get a working demo
* Tempting to think that you can work over co-op
  * But it's challenging after a 9-hour work day

### 4

* For web-related projects:
  * Don't use GoDaddy - Namecheap is recommended
  * Use Google Apps to set up email addresses with your domain name
    * Convenient, email isn't tied to personal accounts
  * YMMV: Very nice/useful to work with a VPS (eg Linode, EC2)
  * Do not need to pay for an SSL certificate
    * startssl.com
  * Frameworks: Django, Ruby on Rails
    * YMMV: Start with a framework that you're not familiar with, to learn about it
    * Be wary with ORM limitations: raw SQL is occasionally better

### 5

* The ultimate deadline is on symposium day at the end of 4B
  * People seem to like great ideas over good implementations of OK ideas

### 6

* More on choosing a team/group
  * Encouraged to work with other people, learn how to work with other people
  * Coming to a full consensus can be very time-consuming, if everybody refuses to budge
    * Maybe choose a team leader who would make the final decision?
    * Derek: A 2011 group had some sort of decision-making process
    * Comment: There *will* be arguments over decisions
    * Comment: The arguments are usually opinion-related; probably won't have a huge impact on the project
* Focus on the design/idea/core of your project
  * Don't get carried away with features
* Customers
  * If finding an external customer, do it early
* Clear communication
  * eg Changing the name to "Project Changed" vs project "Changed"

### 7

* Get Android/iPhone apps into the market ~1 month early to get feedback
  * Can fix bugs, or learn what to expect when demoing on symposium day
